## Background

The building sector contributes to approximately 40% of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. As urban areas continue to grow, sustainable architecture has become crucial for mitigating environmental impact. GreenArch was developed to educate and inspire architects, developers, and city planners to adopt eco-friendly building practices.

## Technologies

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web interface.
- **PyVista**: For 3D model visualization.
- **Pillow**: For image processing.
- **PyVirtualDisplay**: For headless display, particularly useful in server environments.

## Features

- **3D Visualizations**: Interactive models demonstrating sustainable building elements.
- **Alternative Energy Solutions**: Information on energy-efficient technologies, such as solar panels and algae systems.
- **Eco-Friendly Building Materials**: Highlights innovative materials like mycelium-based bricks and recycled plastic.
- **Efficient Cooling Systems**: Demonstrates advanced cooling technologies to reduce energy consumption.
- **Disaster Resilience**: Techniques for building structures that withstand natural disasters.
- **Green Architecture**: Vertical farming, bioclimatic skins, and more sustainable urban planning concepts.
- **Impact of AI in Architecture**: Explores AI applications in sustainable urban planning and resource management.

## Workflow

GreenArch is structured with separate modules for each major topic in sustainable architecture, allowing users to explore each area independently. The application integrates 3D models, images, and interactive content to create an engaging learning experience.

## Backend

The backend is built with **Flask**, handling data retrieval and 3D model loading. It provides APIs to serve model data and content to the frontend, enabling smooth integration between backend data processing and frontend visualization.

## Frontend

The frontend is developed with **React** and **react-three-fiber** for rendering 3D models. **React** provides a dynamic and responsive interface, while **react-three-fiber** enables the integration of 3D visualizations, enhancing the user's interaction with the project.

## Challenges I Ran Into

- **3D Model Rendering**: Integrating and optimizing 3D models for the web posed a performance challenge.
- **Data Processing**: Efficiently handling large data files and model loading for a seamless user experience.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent functionality across various web browsers.

## Accomplishments

- Successfully developed an interactive platform that educates users about sustainable architecture.
- Integrated complex 3D models and visualizations into a web interface.
- Created a visually appealing, user-friendly interface that effectively communicates complex information.

## What I Learned

- Gained hands-on experience with **react-three-fiber** for 3D rendering in web applications.
- Improved knowledge in sustainable building practices and innovative materials.
- Developed skills in handling performance optimization for large 3D models.

## What's Next?
